# GamePass

The Next Generation of web3 gaming.

## Enabling an Easy web3 onbaording for E-Sport gamers

Instead of create web3 native game, why don't we create a layer on top of E-sport focus games like battle royal. GamePass add a new way to incentivize gamers and Events organisers by creating a new way to participate in competitions or Sticy games with friends.

You can see the flow and integrations below :

### Integrations

**Rhinestone ModuleKit**

When users connect to the platform it will generate automatically an Abstract Account.
Then they'll download the GamePass modular kit to participate in the game by depositing they entry tickets to the game with a specific Unique ID.

**Flare Decentralized Data**

After the deposit is done it's stored on the flare chain and the winner data will be store there too so when the winner would want to get the prize, that is the sum of all of the deposit of the loosers. The data will be verifiable.
